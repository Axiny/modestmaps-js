Modest Maps JS is experimental, and under active development.

Plans involve experimentation with the following:

* SVG and Canvas drawing
* Webkit/Gecko CSS transforms/animations
* IE CSS filters.

This is not intended to be a replacement for Mapstraction or OpenLayers. 
If you need that kind of functionality today, I can recommend the Cloudmade
webmaps-lite API: www.cloudmade.com

Please speak up on getsatisfaction.com if you would like to get involved.
