Modest Maps JS Changelog.

Following the semantic versioning recommendation best we can:

   "Consider a version format of X.Y.Z (Major.Minor.Patch). 
    Bug fixes not affecting the API increment the patch version, 
    backwards compatible API additions/changes increment the 
    minor version, and backwards incompatible API changes increment 
    the major version." -- http://semver.org/
